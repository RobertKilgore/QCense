# QCense
QCense is a novel tool that seeks to allow for any size cities' census tract geometry and information to be outputted as a geojson.

# How to Run
This file is meant to be run in a Google Collab notebook. To run it you will need to set the file structure using the required files and change the personal directory to your selected directory in the connecting to drive tab if you are not using collab. The folder Raw GeoJsons containing each state should be in your personal directory for setup.
